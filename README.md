# Modified `apples-mode`, an Emacs mode for working with AppleScript

This is a modified version of the Emacs mode [`apples-mode`](https://github.com/tequilasunset/apples-mode) by user [@tequilasunset](https://github.com/tequilasunset), from 2011. I'm working on adapting it to more recent Emacs versions. This is a work in (slow) progress.
